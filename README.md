# Amazon-ML-Hackathon
Problem Statement:
In this challenge, participants must develop a machine learning model that predicts the optimal selling price of a product listed on an e-commerce platform. The dataset contains product-related information such as catalog content (title and description), image links, and other metadata. The goal is to extract meaningful textual, numerical, and visual features to accurately estimate product prices. Competitors are expected to design a multimodal pipeline combining text-based features (TF-IDF, embeddings), structured attributes (like pack quantity), and image representations. The model should generalize well to unseen products and output precise price predictions for the test dataset. Performance is evaluated using a regression-based metric such as SMAPE on predicted versus actual prices.
